# PsychDiscussions

_**REAL!?!?!??!?!?!?!?!**_

ShadowMario removed the discussions tab on the April 1st of 2022, so here's this.

This is a repo for those who wanted discussions back again, anyways.

# Discussions rules

1. No spam. (unless its _funny_ but if you post spam and its not funny then **you die irl**)
2. No VS Dave & Bambi hate, everyone has opinions about it, but don't act like an annoying hater.
3. DO NOT HATE SHADOWMARIO FOR CLOSING THE DISCUSSIONS TAB.
4. Enjoy.
